Today, I started brainstorming. Imma be honest, I feel completely out of my depth with this one.
With a keyboard, there are plenty of resources, and I had completed Hackpad before to boot.

I'm not sure where to start. 

So, I've taken to gobbling up every resource I can find about pen plotters.

Here are some I've found so far:

Learning about and examining these designs, I'm starting to see a rough bill of materials:
- 2 stepper motors for the x and y axis
- A servo motor to lift and place the pen
- 6 linears rods, 4 for the y axis, 2 for the x axis
- 4 to 8 linear ball bearing(these are kinda expensive)
- 2 stepper motor drivers
- A CNC shield
- A elegoo uno(cheaper than arduino)
- A 12v power supply

One resource I found particularly helpful was [this plotter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_OFkAW_JY&ab_channel=CreativityBuzz) 
designed with wood instead of plastic parts. I foundnthat the design was a lot simpler without any of the frills plastic parts had. 
This was extremely useful in helping me get an idea of how to design the toolhead
